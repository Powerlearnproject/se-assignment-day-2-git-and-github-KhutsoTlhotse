## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is like a time machine for your code,is a systems that tracks or records changes,enabling multiple developers to collaborate efficiently and it assists in maintaining a clean project history.Github is a popular tool for managing versions of code because is an online platform that hosts repositories,giving features that improves collaboration and project management including Cloud-based Storage by enabling access from anywhere in the world,Branching and Merging by assisting developers to work on features separately and merge them when their ready,Collaboration Features to ensure that issues,pull requests and discussions enable team-based development,Security and Backup assist by protecting project history and preventing accidental loss,Integration with DevOps tools are tools that work coherently with CI/CD pipelines,project tracking tools and automation services.
Version control helps in maintaining project integrity by tracking changes so that developers cab review and understand the previous updates,preventing data loss by restoring older versions in case of errors or failures.
